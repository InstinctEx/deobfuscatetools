ManagedDllInjector

Known limitation:
The target process must a window!

This program has two options:
1. Inject the current assembly itself on selected process
Inject button.
Look on the code InjectedClass.cs
and you will see the code that load an assembly:
    	// Here load the assembly from string
    	Assembly asm = Assembly.Load("SSA.Business.Input, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=a58bfd68363575ef");
    	if (asm==null)
    	{
    	MessageBox.Show("Failed to load assembly!");
    	}
       	else
    	{
    	MessageBox.Show("Loaded ok!");
    	}
You can add here asm = Assembly.Load("assemly string")
to load more assemblies.
2. ManagedStack explorer of the selected process,
shown with a MessageBox.
